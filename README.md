This repository contains my job application to Kivra for the position as backend developer.
# Version written in Common Lisp.
I solved the case first in Common Lisp because it is a functional language I have knowledge in.\
You can find the lisp code in the folder lisp.\
To create the executable file run make or 'make all' in the lisp folder.\
Dependencies:
* sbcl
* make\
When testing the code has been compiled and executed on Arch Linux.
