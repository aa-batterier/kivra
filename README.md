This repository contains my job application to Kivra for the position as backend developer.
# Version written in Common Lisp.
I solved the case first in Common Lisp because it is a functional language I have knowledge in.\
You can find the lisp code in the folder lisp.\
To create the executable file run make or 'make all' in the lisp folder.\
The code has been compiled and tested on Arch Linux.\
If the scripts doesn't work, check if the path to sbcl in the beginning of the scripts is correct.\
Dependencies:
* sbcl
* make
# Version written in Erlang.
In the folder erlang are my solutions to part1 and part2 of the case.\
To create the .beam files run make or 'make all' in the erlang folder.\
To run the erlang code from the shell run the script for each part, for example ./part1.\
Make sure to change the permissions on the script files to make them executable with the command chmod +x part1.sh.\
The code has been compiled and tested on Arch Linux.\
Dependencies:
* erlang
* make
* bash
